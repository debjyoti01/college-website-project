<h1>Abstract</h1> 
The purpose of this research is to analyze the use of The Student teacher management system developed by me. In this paper each and every part of the Student teacher management system has been discussed. The key unique feature of The Student teacher management system (STMS) developed by me, is that it will help teachers to record studentsâ€™ attendance directly to college database. Additionally, teachers will be able to schedule their classes and the same will be visible to the students. This will ensure better management of classes by the teachers and will act as a remembrance to the student. The key benefits of the STMS system for the students include they will be able to track their attendance and will be able to communicate directly with the teacher and their peers during the classes through the chat option.
